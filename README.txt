Princioal and Applications of Programming coursework 2, 2016. Charles Ringer.

Project to implement the game Dōbutsu shōgi with a meaningful and inteligent AI. Learn more about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dbutsu_sh%C5%8Dgi

Currently the AI is not implemented but the game engine is built and there is a rudimental front end to wrap it. 
The main job after this WIP handin is to work on the AI as the rest of the project should be implmeneted now.
